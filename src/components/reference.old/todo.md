Fix Chrome Nameless Buttons:
onClick={(e) => {
this.handleButtonClick(e, item.name)
}}
instead of event, pass the name directly, then change the function to
handleButtonClick = (e, name) => {
console.log("Click: " + name);
let updated = Object.assign({}, this.state.fridge);

if (!this.props.fridge.ingredients.includes(name)) {
//console.log('**_JJ_**');
this.props.addItem(name);
}
};
